It highlights how crucial it is to safeguard computer networks from cyber threats because they are fundamental to modern company operations, information sharing, and communication. A group of procedures and guidelines known as network security are intended to protect networks against harmful activity, illegal access, and data breaches. Maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of network resources and data is its key objective, especially in light of the ongoing evolution and sophistication of cyber attacks.The website also addresses cyberattacks, which have impacted businesses of all kinds, have become more frequent and severe in recent years. These attacks cause serious financial losses, interfere with operations, and compromise private data. Cybercriminals employ a variety of strategies, including phishing, malware, ransomware, and social engineering, to take advantage of network weaknesses and obtain illegal access to private information.It also explores a number of important topics related to network security, including cloud security, email security, network segmentation, and protections against malware and illegal access.</tr>
