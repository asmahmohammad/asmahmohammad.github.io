<td>Abstract</td>
<td> The website is about promoting cybersecurity education and career development, with a special focus on initiatives led by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) in the United States. Its core mission is to build a strong cybersecurity workforce to enhance national security. They're doing this through a range of approaches, including bringing cybersecurity concepts into classrooms from an early age with programs like the Cybersecurity Education and Training Assistance Program (CETAP) and providing training to teachers. There's also a strong emphasis on diversity and inclusion, with programs targeting underserved communities. CISA collaborates with educational institutions and the private sector to provide cybersecurity monitoring and training, ensuring that even smaller organizations have access to the cybersecurity skills they need. They work closely with colleges and universities to designate them as National Centers of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense and encourage students to pursue cybersecurity degrees through scholarship programs. They provide a framework for categorizing cybersecurity work with the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE Framework), and their National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies (NICCS) website offers a wealth of information about education, training, and career opportunities in the field. In a nutshell, this website serves as a human-friendly resource for anyone interested in a career in cybersecurity, offering guidance, support, and opportunities to help build a skilled and diverse cybersecurity workforce.</tr>
